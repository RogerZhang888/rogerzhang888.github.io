    I remember showing up in Clementi Camp on 13 March 2023, having no idea what I was getting into. 
    Subsequently, I was posted to G3 Branch, had a chat with the Department Head, and gradually integrated 
    myself into this new environment. And just like that, 22 months have passed.

    The Army is an interesting place. There are uncountable experiences I have had that, safe to say, I will 
    never have in any other setting. It has challenged me, and it has shaped me. I feel fortunate to have 
    met and worked with plenty of genuine, honest people.

    I look back to my first Branch Cohesion/Retreat, then all the way to my last one. It is a whole “change of 
    guard”, yet the determination and tenacity to strive higher remains. I have nothing but respect and 
    admiration for each and every one who selflessly serves for the defence of our nation.

    Whichever stage of life you are in, give it your best shot and leave with no regrets. I hope I have been a 
    valuable contributor to the Division. It has been a memorable two years. Now it is time to close this door 
    and begin a new chapter in my life. Thanks for everything. SWS
